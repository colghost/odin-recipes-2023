    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>If going to the Cracker Barrell is too much work, this might be perfect.</p>
        <p>I'm hungry just thinking about it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large chicken breasts, halved</li>
            <li>a whole bunch of vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 pint buttermilk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>After cutting chicken, put it in freezer bag and dump buttermilk over it. Refrigerate for one hour prior to cooking.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat cooking oil to about 350 degrees. You want atleast 2 inches of oil in the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Mix together flour and all the other dry ingredients in a shallow dish or on a plate until fully combined. Immediately remove about a quarter cup of the flour mixture and set aside.</li>
        <li>In another shallow dish, mix together your eggs and milk. Whisk it well.</li>
        <li>Dredge your chicken through the flour mixture, then through the milk/egg mixture, then back through the flour mix again</li>
        <li>Toss those birds in the preheated oil. Don't crowd the pan. You'll regret it.</li>
        <li>Cook each piece for about three minuites on each side. Remove to a paper towl-lined plate or a rakc over paper towels to drain the grease.</li>
        <li>Drain just about all the oil. Leave enough in teh bottom to make a roux and keep the "drippings" in the bottom.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the heat, add in the flour mixture, and stir it to combine with the grease.</li>
        <li>Once the gravy is gravied, whisk in your chicken stock. Once that comes to a simmer, dump in heavy whipping cream. Bring back to a simmer. Get it thick.</li>
        <li>Remove gravy from heat and let it cool for about five minutes. Plate your chicken and serve with gravy.</li>
        </ol>
