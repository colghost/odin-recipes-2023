    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

        <li>1-2 cups of marinara sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked pasta or rice (optional)</li>
        <li>shredded parmeson for topping</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Pound the chicken breasts out with a meat mallet, a hammer, or the floor. Should be 1/2in thick <b>max</b>. Salt and pepper the chicken and let it rest for a bit.</b></li>
        <li>Pour the breadcrumbs onto a plate and dredge your chicken through the crumbs until both sides are completely covered.</li>
        <li>Put your breasts into the air fryer at 350 for seven minutes. After seven minutes, flip the chicken and fry for an additional five minutes.</li>
        <li>If serving with pasta or rice, add a little sauce on top of the pile o' carbs. Serve chick atop the carbs and cover with more sauce. Top with parm and serve!</li>
